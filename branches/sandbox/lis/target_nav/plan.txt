package name: target_nav

tracks a target with the camera and possibly the head to provide global localization for navigation.


packages to use:
pr2_head_action - to point the head
checkerboard_detector - to find the target

If head tracking is off:

- Publish the map w.r.t. the odom_combined frame.
- If the camera loses sight of the target, assume the odom is correct

If head tracking is on:

- The head moves to keep the target in the center of the FOV.
- If the target is no longer detected by the camera, the old pose is still published, but the head begins moving in a searching pattern to look for the target again.

Otherwise:

tf frames:
map - (parent of odom_combined), provides the most recent location of the robot

messages:
target_pose - the target's position/rotation w.r.t. the base_link frame

services:
stop_head_track - stops the head from moving
start_head_track - starts the head moving again
is_detected - boolean whether the object is in the camera's FOV
