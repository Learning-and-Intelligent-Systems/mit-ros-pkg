How to estimate ball orientations:

		1. Resize ball image to 32x32.
		2. Use imfilter to align ball image with avg. ball image.
		3. Crop pixels outside ball radius.
		4. Normalize lighting w.r.t. avg. (aligned) ball image.
		5. Invert ball image (so logo pixels are white).
		6. Find weighted centroid of pixels.
		7. Use mean-shift (local 5x5 grid search) on blurred ball image to find local pixel max.
8. If local max pixel value < w_thresh, return (no logo found).
9. Mask out pixels farther than r/2 away from the logo center.

10. Compute 3D pixel locations on ball.
11. Recompute logo center "mu" as 3D weighted mean.
12. Project logo points into tangent space at "mu".
13. Compute principal curvature direction, "pc".
14. Use "mu" and "pc" to generate a pair of quaternion orientations, q1 and q2.
15. (Optional) Use the principal curvatures ratio to make bingham distributions on q1 and q2.
