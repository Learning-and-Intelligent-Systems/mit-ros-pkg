Welcome to Example 5: a Simple WAM Move Program.

To continue, ensure the following steps have been taken:
  a) All WAM power and signal cables are securely fastened.
  b) The WAM is powered on (receiving power).
  c) All E-STOPs are released.
  d) The WAM is in Shift+Idle mode.
  e) The WAM is in its home (folded) position.
Press [Enter] to continue.

Initializing system buses ... 1 buses found.
Setting up the CAN bus thread ... done.
Setting up the WAM control thread ... done.
Shift+Activate the WAM, and press [Enter] to continue.

Setting gravity compensation to 1.0 g.

Press [Enter] to start a joint space move,
  with velocity = 0.500000, acceleration = 0.500000.
  ... done.
Press [Enter] to disable the joint-space position constraint.

Press [Enter] to start a cartesian space move,
  with velocity = 0.500000, acceleration = 0.500000.
  ... done.
Press [Enter] to disable the Cartesian position constraint.

Place the WAM back into its home position,
  idle it with Shift+Idle,
  and press [Enter] to end the program.

Stopping the control thread ... done.
Closing the system ... done.
