This is the action interface to the <a href=http://www.ros.org/wiki/ee_cart_imped_control>ee_cart_imped_control</a> package.  The controller executes trajectories for force/impedance control of a chain of joints.  The action monitors the controller and aborts goals if they are not reachable or deviate too far from user-specified constraints.  Therefore, interaction with the controller should always be done through the action.  For a wrapper around the simple action client in Python, see the Python API.

Classes:
- \b EECartImpedExecuter : the executer class that talks to the action server and the controller
- \b EECartImpedArm : a wrapper for an action client that simplifies specifying, starting, and stopping trajectories


<!--
Provide links to specific auto-generated API documentation within your
package that is of particular interest to a reader. Doxygen will
document pretty much every part of your code, so do your best here to
point the reader to the actual API.

If your codebase is fairly large or has different sets of APIs, you
should use the doxygen 'group' tag to keep these APIs together. For
example, the roscpp documentation has 'libros' group.
