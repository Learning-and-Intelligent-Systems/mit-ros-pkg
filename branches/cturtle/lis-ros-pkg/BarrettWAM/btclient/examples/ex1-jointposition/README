Example 1 - Reading the joint angles of the WAM (in radians)

This is meant to be the simplest possible program that uses a WAM. All it does is
initialize the WAM communications, data structures, and start the control loop thread.

To compile & run:

1. # make all
2. Switch on WAM
3. Idle WAM (Press SHIFT and IDLE buttons on pendant. The yellow light should come on)
4. # ./ex1
