              *** Welcome to the WAM control source code! ***

We are continually improving and evolving the WAM source code. Please visit
http://wiki.barrett.com for information on how to update to the latest version
available, plus many helpful tips on running your new WAM.

The directory structure looks like this:
btclient    <-- This directory
   doc      <-- doxygen-generated source documentation
   examples <-- Some simple and advanced examples on how to use the library
      ex1
      ..
      ex8
   include  <-- All the header files related to the WAM control library
   lib      <-- The compiled library binaries
   src      <-- Library source code + utilities + full demo (btdiag)
      btdiag   <-- Full demo application with many features
      btsystem <-- Control library, not robot-specific
      btutil   <-- Utility application for testing/debugging
      btwam    <-- WAM-specific control functions
      
                         *** The wam.conf file ***
The *.conf files define the WAM configuration and parameters for any control
application. The home position, torque limits, mass parameters, kinematics, and
PID parameters are all defined in here. Most example programs reference the
"wam.conf" file in their OpenWAM() function. The wam.conf file is only a 
symbolic link to one of several standard configuration files like WAM4.conf 
(4DOF WAM), or WAM7.conf (7DOF WAM). These files were tuned to your specific WAM 
during final checkout. It is important to keep these files safe (make backups), 
as we may not be able to replace them in the event of a disk failure or 
accidental deletion.

Also, if you download a software update, the configuration files in the config/
directory will be updated with the latest configuration data and features. 
Your tuned files in btclient/ will not be touched. After an update, you will
want to compare your tuned configuration file with the newly updated one in the
config/ directory. You will need to copy any *newly added* parameters to your
tuned file. You should be cautious about copying any *updated* parameters, as
those parameters may only apply to the latest WAMs and not to your WAM.

                           *** The Makefiles ***
You will also notice two files named config.mk and common.mk in this directory.

The config.mk file contains important compiler definitions for your PC setup.
We support two different realtime operating systems: Linux/RTAI and 
Linux/Xenomai. We also support two different CANbus communication cards:
esd-Electronics and PEAK-System. Finally, the Peak card can be on an ISA bus
(typically PC/104) or a PCI bus (most desktop PCs). The settings in this file
MUST match your PC setup for the software to compile and run correctly.

The common.mk file sets up all the necessary includes, libraries, and defines
for the compilation process. This file is referenced by each individual
application's Makefile, in order to make the Makefiles easier to manage and
reduce clutter.

                        *** To build the software ***
To rebuild everything: "sh makeall" in the this directory.
To build the btsystem library: "make; make install" in src/btsystem
To build the btwam library: "make; make install" in src/btwam
To build other apps: "make" in the app directory
To force a clean build: "make clean; make" (libs also require "make install")
