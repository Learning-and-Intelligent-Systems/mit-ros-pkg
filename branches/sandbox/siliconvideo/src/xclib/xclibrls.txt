    RELEASE NOTES: XCLIB  - Version 3.0, V3.7

      1.  Version 3.0 released.  Adds support for Windows Vista, Windows  XP(x64),
          and Linux 64 Bit.

          Under Linux, direct mapping of frame buffer memory into the  application
          memory space is now supported under 2.6 kernels.

          Applications using SCF style functions need not recompile.

          Applications using non-SCF functions or PXIPL  functions  should  recom-
          pile.   Applications using ::bufferSaveStream or ::bufferLoadStream must
          add two parameters of 0.  A new ::iosparse service is  added.   (28-Feb-
          2007)

      2.  Modified Feature:  The return  value  of  pxd_videoFieldCount  has  been
          changed  from ulong to pxvbtime_t for consistent sizing under various 64
          bit compilers.  This should not affect existing 16 or 32  bit  programs,
          and the old and new types are the same size integers, albeit with a dif-
          ferent type name.  (28-Feb-2007).

      3.  Fixed Feature:  When using more than one PIXCI(R), some errors  such  as
          PCI FIFO overflow, on units other than the first may not be reported via
          pxd_mesgFault,  pxd_mesgFaultText,  ::faultMessageBox,  etc.    (16-Mar-
          2007).

      4.  Fixed    Feature:     Under     Vista,     the     pxd_eventFieldCreate,
          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate,  and  pxd_eventGPTriggerCreate,  may fail.
          (??-???-2007)

      5.  Fixed Feature:  XCAP for Linux 64 bit shows a  `Usage  error  or  fault'
          when  trying  to open the PIXCI(R) imaging board.  In XCLIB for Linux 64
          bit, the ::getDevParms suffers a similar fate, but the SCF functions are
          not affected as they don't use ::getDevParms.  (30-Mar-2007)

      6.  Added      Feature:       Functions      pxd_SV9M001_setExposureAndGain,
          pxd_SV9M001_setResolutionAndTiming  and other related functions now pro-
          vide camera specific controls for the SILICON  VIDEO(R)  5C10  and  5M10
          camera.  (18-Apr-2007).

      7.  Fixed Feature:  Per-pixel offset (only)  corrections/normalizations  did
          not  work  correctly  under  Linux, and under 64 bit Windows.  Per-pixel
          gain corrections did not work correctly in configurations which did  map
          map frame buffer memory into application space.  (27-May-2007)

      8.  Fixed Feature:  For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 5C10 and 5M10 cameras, changing
          the  exposure  twice  within one field may cause the video to stop until
          the camera head is reset.  (31-May-2007).

      9.  Fixed Feature:  Under 64 bit Windows, with frame  buffer  memory  mapped
          `on-demand',  when using a PIXCI(R) SV4, SV5 or any Camera Link compati-
          ble board, and when using more than one imaging board (or more than  one
          functional  unit),  all but the first imaging board may fail to open and
          no description of the error is provided via  pxd_mesgFault().   (18-Jun-
          2007).

     10.  Fixed  Feature:   Under   Windows   Vista,   the   pxd_eventFieldCreate,
          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate,  and  pxd_eventGPTriggerCreate  may  fail,
          returning NULL.  (20-Jun-2007).

     11.  Fixed Feature:  The PIXCI(R) driver released approximately 11 July  2007
          did  not operate properly with the SV9M001, SV9M001C, SV9M001.  (24-Jul-
          2007)

     12.  Fixed Feature:  Depending on multi-processor  configuration  and  speed,
          the  second  functional half of the PIXCI(R) EL1DB, E1DB, E4DB may drop,
          garble, or duplicate serial characters.  (02-Aug-2007)

     13.  Fixed Feature:   The  PIXCI(R)  CL3SD  may  intermittently  report  `DMA
          Transfer  Error'  on  newer,  faster  computers, or where the PCI bus is
          inherently slow or heavily loaded.  (04-Aug-2007)

     14.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) SI4 PCI Express imag-
          ing boards (Beta).  (21-Dec-2007)

     15.  Modified Feature:  The `Share Unit' driver configuration  parameter  now
          defaults  to  `share'  under Windows NT, 2000, XP, XP(x64), Server 2003,
          and Vista, to allow easier use of the  clserEPX.DLL  along  with  XCAP's
          Generic Camera Link controls.  (26-Dec-2007)

     16.  Improved Feature:  The PIXCI(R) SV5B  is  now  supported  distinct  from
          PIXCI(R)  SV5;  the  default  SV5B  video  setup  is NTSC, not the SV5's
          NTSC/YC.  (20-Feb-2008).

     17.  Fixed Feature:  The compilation instructions in XCLIBEXC.CPP has  typo's
          referring  to  XCLIBEX2.CPP  and XCLIBEX2.RC instead of XCLIBEXC.CPP and
          XCLIBEXC.RC, respectively.  (04-Mar-2008)

     18.  Fixed Feature:  For SILICON VIDEO(R) 9T001, 5C10, and 5M10  cameras,  if
          XCAP  is  configured  for  `Long Exposure' and a format file exported to
          XCLIB, the XCLIB's configuration will not be set  for  `Long  Exposure'.
          (04-Mar-2008)

     19.  Added Feature:  Adds support for Windows Vista(x64) with Service Pack  1
          or  later;  use  with  Vista(x64) prior to SP1 is not recommended.  (13-
          Apr-2008)

     20.  New Feature:  The pxd_buffersSysTicks2 returns the 64 bit system time of
          a  buffer's  capture,  extending  the existing pxd_buffersSysTicks which












                                        - 3 -



          only returns the lower 32 bits.  (11-Jul-2007)

     21.  Fixed Feature:  For some PIXCI(R) SI cards, after PC power up, the  card
          must  be opened twice:  the first open fails, the second (and following)
          opens succeed.  (17-Jul-2007)

     22.  Modified Feature:  Controlled mode for the  SILICON  VIDEO(R)  5C10/5M10
          has  been  modified  and improved to use the chip's `GRR Snapshot' mode;
          providing common start-of-exposure for  all  lines  instead  of  rolling
          start-of-exposure.  (The sensor still uses a rolling shutter, thus expo-
          sure time of lines differs.  Use of a strobe light is expected).

             The SILICON VIDEO(R) 5C10/5M10 does not  support  horizontal  subsam-
          pling  by  a  factor  of 8; software has been changed to disallow such a
          choice.  (29-Aug-2007)

     23.  Modified Feature:  The default frame buffer size under Windows NT, 2000,
          XP,  Server  2003,  and  Vista has been increased to 32 MByte.  (01-Sep-
          2007)

     24.  Modified Feature:  Controlled mode for the SILICON  VIDEO(R)  9T001  has
          been  modified  and  improved to use the chip's `Global' mode; providing
          common start-of-exposure for all  lines  instead  of  rolling  start-of-
          exposure.   (The sensor still uses a rolling shutter, thus exposure time
          of lines differs.  Use of a strobe light is expected).  (07-Nov-2007)

     25.  Improved Feature:  For  PIXCI(R) E1DB,  EL1DB,  E4DB,  and  PIXCI(R) SI4
          imaging  boards,  under  Windows  2000, XP, XP(x64), Server 2003, Vista,
          Linux 32 Bit and Linux 64 Bit, it is no longer required that  the  first
          functional  unit  be  opened before (or together with) latter functional
          units of the same physical board.  (14-Jan-2008)

     26.  Modified Feature:  For Windows  95,  98,  ME,  2000,  XP,  Server  2003,
          XP(x64),  and  Vista  the  driver  installation .inf file no longer sets
          default driver configuration parameters into the  registry  (except  for
          the  PIXCI(R)  CL3SD) instead allowing the driver to set defaults inter-
          nally.  This avoids resetting the user's  altered  driver  configuration
          parameters should a second PIXCI(R) card be installed later, or the ori-
          ginal card moved from slot to slot.  (24-Jan-2008)

     27.  Fixed Feature:  For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 5C10 and 5M10:  after switching
          from controlled mode to free-run, the frame rate may stay at 0 until the
          pixel clock frequency is changed.  When switching to controlled mode and
          single  shot,  the  first trigger may not generate an exposure and image
          readout.  (11-Mar-2008)

     28.  Fixed Feature:  Under Windows 2000, XP,  and  Vista,  on  some  (newer?)
          motherboards, when using Map Frame Buffer on demand in Sys and not using
          Map Frame Buffer Direct into App after the PIXCI imaging board has  been
          successfully opened and used and closed several times, an `Unable to map

          image memory! (DDK MmMapIoSpace)' may be reported; the error is  cleared
          by rebooting Windows.  (27-Mar-2008)

     29.  Fixed Feature:  For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 5C10 and 5M10:  On some  camera
          heads  with  the gain set to the default of 0 dB, the image is noisy and
          does not saturate.  (25-Apr-2008)

     30.  Improved Feature:  The SCF functions now support use of multiple imaging
          boards  with  different  resolution  and/or camera configuration (previ-
          ously, multiple imaging boards with  identical  configuration  was  sup-
          ported).   The  feature  is  activated  by  importing a video setup file
          created by XCAP in `Use Individual Formats & Controls'  mode.   The  SCF
          functions  are still limited to use of identical imaging boards; in some
          cases multiple boards of the model but different revision level may also
          be allowed.  (01-Jun-2008)

     31.  Improved Feature:  The new  XCLIBEXC.TXT  provides  a  SILICON  VIDEO(R)
          specific example for use with VB.NET.  (13-Jun-2008)

     32.  Improved Feature:  For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 5C10 and 5M10:   Previously,
          the  camera  exposure  was  set  in multiples of line periods; the error
          (difference between exposure requested and exposure  implemented)  could
          be  up to one half a line period.  Exposure control is now improved, and
          for small AOI's (less than half maximum width)  the  exposure  error  is
          typically a few pixel clock periods, but up to (approximately) one quar-
          ter of a line period for larger AOI's.  (23-Jun-2008)

     33.  New Feature:  Now has partial and beta-level  support  for  new  SILICON
          VIDEO(R) 9C10 camera.  (01-Jul-2008)

     34.  Improved Feature:  For 64 bit Windows and 64 bit Linux: new driver  con-
          figuration  options  allow specifying that frame buffer memory should be
          allocated under the 4  GB address.  This allows using 32 bit  PCI  cards
          even on systems with more than 4 GB of memory.  (09-Jul-2008)

     35.  Fixed Feature:  The pxd_saveTiff and ::imageSaveTiff may fail when  used
          with  RGB+Pad or BGR+Pad format cameras with forceful frame buffer allo-
          cation, or with non-forceful  allocation  that  isn't  mapped  into  the
          application's space.  (11-Jul-2008)

     36.  New Feature:  For PIXCI(R) CL2, E1 and newer imaging  boards  supporting
          Camera Link, but not for the older PIXCI(R) CL1 and CL3SD, new functions
          pxd_setCameraLinkCCOut and  pxd_getCameraLinkCCOut  allows  setting  the
          value  of  the Camera Link CC output lines, for those CC lines which are
          not otherwise in use for video control.  (16-Jul-2008)

     37.  New Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) ECB1 ExpressCard/54  imag-
          ing board.  (18-Aug-2008)














                                        - 5 -



     38.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now supports bit packed pixels  in  conjunction
          with per pixel normalization.  (22-Sep-2008)

     39.  New Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) SI4 Rev. 2 imaging  board.
          Use of an older XCLIB and/or driver with a PIXCI(R) SI4 Rev. 2 card will
          only work if a pixel clock frequency of 48 MHz is chosen.  (07-Oct-2008)

     40.  Fixed Feature:  On PIXCI(R) CL1 imaging  boards,  a  PCI  FIFO  Overflow
          error  causes  serial  communication to halt until video capture is res-
          tarted, or the serial port disabled & renabled.  (27-Oct-2008)

     41.  New Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) EB1 imaging  board.   (18-
          Nov-2008)

     42.  New Feature:  Now supports the SILICON VIDEO(R) 9C10 camera in  free-run
          and controlled global modes.  (03-Dec-2008)

     43.  Fixed Feature:  On some SILICON VIDEO(R) 5M10  or  5C10  cameras  heads,
          when  the  pixel  clock  frequency  is changed and the gain is set to 0,
          pixel values will be noisy and limited to less than 255/4095  until  the
          gain is changed at least once.  (09-Jan-2009)

     44.  New Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R)  EB1-PoCL  imaging  board.
          (11-Feb-2009)

     45.  Fixed Feature:  The pxd_doSnap would  occasionally  return  0  (success)
          when capture had, in fact, been terminated due to, for example, PCI FIFO
          Overflow.  The pxd_mesgFault or pxd_mesgFaultText were not affected, and
          were reliable means to detect PCI FIFO Overflow.  (13-Feb-2009)

     46.  New    Feature:     Added     functions     pxd_eventFaultCreate     and
          pxd_eventFaultClose  allow notification of faults - via events, signals,
          or callbacks depending on O.S. - instead of polling  via  pxd_mesgFault.
          (04-Mar-2009)

     47.  New Feature:  For Windows, NT, 2000,  XP,  and  Vista,  added  functions
          pxd_eventFieldCreate2,                    pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate2,
          pxd_eventGPTriggerCreate2, and pxd_eventFaultCreate2 are  variations  of
          pxd_eventFieldCreate,                      pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate,
          pxd_eventGPTriggerCreate, and pxd_eventFaultCreate that allow  selection
          of  a notification style event instead of a synchronization style event.
          (05-Mar-2009)

     48.  Fixed Feature:  With a PIXCI(R) D2X, CL1, or SI, with  versions  of  the
          V3.0  driver  with  added support for PCI Express, invoking ::getDevInfo
          while video capture is pending or in progress may cause the  video  cap-
          ture to be aborted.  (10-Mar-2009)

     49.  Fixed & Improved Feature:  Under Linux, attempting to re-open an already
          open  PIXCI(R)  imaging  board  caused  errors  and  crashes even if -XU

          disallowed sharing.  Sharing is now supported.  (27-Mar-2009)

     50.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now has preliminary support  for  the  PIXCI(R)
          SI1.  (01-Apr-2009)

     51.  Improved Feature:  For Linux, two versions of each library is  now  pro-
          vided,  one  compiled  with -fPIC and one compiled without.  Previously,
          the libraries were compiled without -fPIC.  14-Apr-2009

     52.  Improved Feature:  For Linux 2.6  and  later  kernels  and  Camera  Link
          PIXCI(R)  cards,  the  driver  now  offers  /dev/tty style access to the
          serial port.  Node names are /dev/ttyPIXCI0 for unit  0,  /dev/ttyPIXCI1
          for unit 1, etc.  Note that this mapping holds even if unit 0, for exam-
          ple, is not a Camera Link card and thus doesn't have a serial port -  in
          which case, opening /devttyPIXCI0 will fail.  Only the Camera Link stan-
          dard baud rates are supported.  (21-Apr-2009)

     53.  New Feature:  XCLIB now supports  the  PIXCI(R)  ECB1-34  ExpressCard/34
          imaging board.  (14-May-2009)

     54.  Improved Feature:  Under 64 bit operating systems, XCLIB now supports up
          to 16 PIXCI(R) imaging boards.  (01-Jun-2009)

     55.  New Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) ECB2 ExpressCard/54  imag-
          ing board.  (03-Jun-2009)

     56.  Fixed  Feature:   When  using  a  SILICON  VIDEO(R)  camera,  and  using
          pxd_SV2112,  pxd_SV1310,  pxd_SV1281,  or  pxd_SV9M001  functions, using
          pxd_videoFormatAsIncluded with a format file which has I2C (i.e.  camera
          head) configuration commands will cause unexpected results as the camera
          head state which is cached by  pxd_SV2112,  pxd_SV1310,  pxd_SV1281,  or
          pxd_SV9M001 is not updated with the camera state set by the format file.
          (04-Jun-2009)

     57.  Clarified Feature:  The 'properties' of the PIXCI(R) driver for  XP(x64)
          &  Vista(x64)  describe  it  as  supporting only XP(x64).  This does not
          affect the driver's operation under Vista(x64).  (01-Jul-2009)

     58.  Fixed Feature:  When using a PIXCI(R) SI4, depending  on  the  order  in
          which  the  4  units  are opened and the cameras initialized, an `Eeprom
          contents invalid (0xffff:0xffff)' error may occur.  This can be resolved
          either  with a FPGA update, or with a updated PIXCI(R) driver.  (24-Jul-
          2009)

     59.  Fixed Feature:  When using multiple PIXCI(R) imaging boards, the `struct
          pxdevfault'  and/or  pxd_mesgFault  messages  may  indicate the affected
          units as their physical sequential number, or  as  a  sequential  number
          relative  to the units actually opened.  Usage is now, consistently, the
          physical sequential number.  (03-Aug-2009)

     60.  New Feature:  Now has partial (can configure camera via .fmt  file,  but
          does  not  yet  have camera specific API) and beta-level support for new
          SILICON VIDEO(R) 643 camera.  (24-Aug-2009)

     61.  Modified Feature:  The default pixel clock  frequency  for  the  SILICON
          VIDEO(R)  9C10  has  been  changed  from 70 MHz (7.2 fps) to 48 MHz (4.8
          fps).  (18-Sep-2009)

     62.  Version 3.7 released.  Adds support for Windows 7 and 7(x64).   (07-Nov-
          2009)

     63.  New   Feature:    For   SILICON   VIDEO(R)   cameras,   new    functions
          pxd_SV2112_getMinMaxExposure,          pxd_SV2112_getMinMaxCtrlExposure,
          pxd_SV1310_getMinMaxExposure,              pxd_SV1281_getMinMaxExposure,
          pxd_SV9M001_getMinMaxExposure,              pxd_SV642_getMinMaxExposure,
          pxd_SV643_getMinMaxExposure, and  pxd_SV643_getMinMaxCtrlExposure  allow
          obtaining  the  minimum  and  maximum  allowable  exposures,  which vary
          depending on other camera parameters such as pixel clock frequency, area
          of interest, subsampling, etc.  These functions avoid having to actually
          set the exposure to a low or high value and query  the  result,  or  use
          non-SCF functions, to obtain the same information.  (18-Dec-2009)

     64.  Improved Feature:  Fault messages now show multiple units as  a  0-based
          list  of  units numbers, such as `0,3,6' instead of a hexadecimal number
          whose bits represent units, such as `0x45'.  (06-Jan-2010)

     65.  Fixed Feature:  With multiple boards, with multiple  memory  partitions,
          depending  on  the  relaive number of boards and partitions, some of the
          memory may not have been assigned to any board.  (13-Jan-2010)

     66.  Modified Feature:  The ::xclib_open now applied  the  formatname  before
          the formatfile, if both are specified.  This provides a better result in
          the common case of accidently using pxd_PIXCIopen with  both  formatname
          and  formatfile.  (While pxd_PIXCIopen declares such as case invalid, no
          error is given).  (27-Jan-2010)

     67.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) SI2 imaging board.

     68.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R)  SV7  imaging  board.
          (03-Apr-2010)

     69.  Improved  Feature:   New   function   pxd_SV643_setExposureAndGainOffset
          extends  pxd_SV643_setExposureAndGain,  allowing  easy adjustment of the
          offset (black level).  (03-May-2010)

     70.  Fixed Feature:  Under Windows, the optional high resolution kernel timer
          selectable  via  Driver Configuration Parameters isn't actually enabled.
          (19-May-2010)














                                        - 8 -



     71.  Improved Feature:  Function names in the XCLIB 32  bit  DLL's  now  have
          simple  aliases, so that Visual Basic, .NET, LabView, etc. can call, for
          example,   pxd_PIXCIopen   instead   of   the   full,   decorated   name
          _pxd_PIXCIopen@12.  (28-May-2010)

     72.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now supports  the  PIXCI(R)  ELS2  PCI  Express
          imaging boards (Beta).  (21-Jun-2010)

     73.  Improved Feature:  New SCF+  functions,  prefixed  as  pxe_,  now  allow
          operating multiple, non-identical PIXCI(R) imaging boards without having
          to use the structured functions.  The pxe_ functions share  the  simpli-
          city of the pxd_ functions.  (17-Aug-2010)

     74.  Fixed   Feature:    For   SILICON    VIDEO(R)    9C10    cameras,    the
          pxd_SV9M001_setVideoAndTriggerMode  function  did not allow setting con-
          trolled mode.  (14-Sep-2010)

     75.  Fixed Feature:  For PIXCI(R) SI2 imaging boards  under  a  64  bit  O.S.
          where  the  PC  has  more  than  4 GB of memory, image data may be black
          depending on whether allocated buffers were above  or  below  the  4  GB
          address.  (22-Sep-2010)

     76.  New Feature:  XCLIB now supports 32 bit applications under 64  bit  Win-
          dows  (previously  only  64  bit  applications were supported) using the
          XCLIBWNT.DLL (32 bit DLL) and the EPIXXCW6.SYS (64 bit driver).  The  32
          bit  applications  have  the same limits as under 32 bit Windows - frame
          buffer memory is limited to less than 4 GByte.  Also, the  frame  buffer
          memory must be in the lower 4 MByte of PC memory.  (11-Oct-2010)

     77.  New Feature:  New pxd_SILICONVIDEO_ functions operate with  all  SILICON
          VIDEO(R)  cameras.  Use of the camera specific pxd_SV2112_, pxd_SV1310_,
          pxd_SV1281_,  pxd_SV642_,  pxd_SV643_,  and  pxd_SV9M001_  functions  is
          deprecated.  (Oct-2010)

     78.  Fixed Feature:  The XCLIBWNT_VBNET.TXT declarations for  use  with  .NET
          have  been  fixed;  declarations  which involve `passing' of arrays were
          missing the `ByRef' adjective.  (20-Oct-2010)

     79.  Fixed Feature:  Under some conditions, following  addition  of  the  new
          feature  described  in the 01-Jun-2008 entry, the pxd_goLiveSeq may ini-
          tiate sequence capture twice which may cause problems  in  some  trigger
          modes.  (25-Oct-2010).

     80.  Improved Feature:  For PIXCI(R) imaging boards with multiple  functional
          units (e.g. EL1DB, E4DB, SI2, SI4, ...)  and under a Windows Plug & Play
          O.S.  (i.e. Windows 2000 and later) the default -DM selection  of  which
          (functional) units are to be opened is changed from the first functional
          unit (i.e. -DM 0x01) to all functional units of the first physical board
          (i.e.  -DM  0x03  for  boards  with two functional units or -DM 0x0F for
          boards with four functional units).  (15-Nov-2010)












                                        - 9 -



     81.  New Feature:  Now supports the SILICON VIDEO(R) WGA-C and WGA-M cameras.
          (14-Dec-2010)

     82.  New Feature:  Now supports the PIXCI(R) SV5L  imaging  board.   (06-Jan-
          2011)

     83.  Fixed Feature:  With PIXCI(R) imaging boards  with  multiple  functional
          units  (EL1DB, E4DB, SI2, SI4, ECB2), when used with multiple processors
          or multi-core processors, a BSoD may occur when  the  imaging  board  is
          closed.  (01-Jan-2011)

     84.  New Feature:  Functions pxd_eventSerialCreate  and  pxd_eventSerialClose
          allow  signalling  the  application  upon  activity  on the serial port.
          (17-Jan-2011).

     85.  Fixed Feature:  On some(?) 64 bit machines, sequence capture  may  cause
          PCI  FIFO  Adrs  errors,  even when live capture, or live alternate pair
          capture, does not.   Reducing  the  number  of  memory  partitions  used
          appears  to  eliminate  the problem.  The underlying cause and alternate
          solutions are being investigated.  (07-Feb-2011)

     86.  Fixed Feature:  For PIXCI(R) imaging  boards  with  multiple  functional
          units  (ECB2,  EL1DB,  E4DB, SI2, SI4, etc.)  the default submodel (i.e.
          camera type) of all but the first functional unit may rarely,  randomly,
          be incorrect.  (09-Feb-2011)

    RELEASE NOTES: XCLIB  - Version 2.2

      1.  This release adds support for Windows XP.  (03-Dec-2001).

      2.  Added Feature:  Function  pxd_SV2112_setExposureAndGain  allows  setting
          the  current  exposure  and gain for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 2112 and 2112C
          cameras.  Function pxd_SV2112_setResolutionAndTiming allows setting  the
          current  decimation,  AOI, scan direction, and pixel clock frequency for
          the   SILICON   VIDEO(R)   2112   and    2112C    cameras.     Functions
          pxd_SV2112_getExposure,   pxd_SV2112_getGain,  pxd_SV2112_getDecimation,
          pxd_SV2112_getAoiTop,  pxd_SV2112_getAoiLeft,  pxd_SV2112_getPixelClock,
          and  pxd_SV2112_getScanDirection  allow  obtaining the eponymous setting
          for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 2112 and 2112C cameras.  (03-Dec-2001).

      3.  Added Feature:  A SILICON VIDEO(R) 2112 and 2112C specific example  pro-
          gram,  XCLIBEXC.CPP,  demonstrates  capture,  display, adjustment of the
          camera's settings.  (03-Dec-2001).

      4.  Fixed Feature:  The new ::goingBufStatus service may cause system termi-
          nation  when  used  with  multiple  boards, and when used on any but the
          first board.  (13-Dec-2001).

      5.  Added Feature:  For SILICON IMAGING  3170  cameras,  video  setup  files
          saved by XCAP now contain the necessary serial commands to (re)configure












                                        - 10 -



          the camera.  Upon open, XCLIB now reconfigures  the  camera  with  these
          serial commands.  (18-Jan-2002).

      6.  Added       Feature:        New       functions        pxd_getGPTrigger,
          pxd_eventGPTriggerCreate,  and pxd_eventGPTriggerClose provide SCF level
          access to the software detectable trigger provided on PIXCI(R)  D,  D24,
          D32,  D2X,  and  D3X  image boards.  These functions are not needed when
          using a camera which itself is in trigger mode.   Rather,  they  can  be
          used  to  detect  a  trigger  with  cameras in continuous mode where the
          PIXCI(R) trigger input has no direct effect on camera or PIXCI(R)  imag-
          ing board.  (01-Feb-2002).

      7.  Fixed Feature:  The pxd_defineImage3 with some combinations  of  imaging
          boards and cameras would produce a program fault.  (08-Feb-2002).

      8.  Fixed Feature:  On PIXCI(R) and cameras  which  produce  more  than  one
          pixel  per  clock,  the `vidres.x.vidoffset' was interpreted in units of
          pixel clocks, instead of pixels.  (13-Feb-2002).

      9.  Fixed Feature:  The PIXCI(R) Windows VXD and SYS files,  the  XCLIB  DLL
          files,  and  the  PXIPL  DLL files did not have correct, or did not have
          any, version information shown with the files' properties (such  as  via
          the Windows Explorer).  (20-Feb-2002).

     10.  Fixed/Added Feature:  The pxd_getFieldCount function  mentioned  in  the
          Conversion  of  Application  Programs from XCOBJ was not documented.  It
          has been renamed to pxd_videoFieldCount (a function under the  old  name
          persists  for compatibility) and documented.  The pxd_getFieldsPerFrame,
          never    mentioned    or    documented,    has    been    renamed     to
          pxd_videoFieldsPerFrame and documented.  (27-Feb-2002).

     11.  Improved/Fixed Feature:  The maximum number of bits per pixel value com-
          ponent was limited to 14, and has been changed to 16.  (09-Apr-2002).

     12.  Fixed Feature:  When switching the SV2112 camera from controlled back to
          continuous  video  mode, the pxd_SV2112_setVideoAndTriggerMode had to be
          called twice (with the same parameters).  (02-May-2002).

     13.  Improved Feature:  The XCLIBEXC.CPP example program for use with  SV2112
          and   SV2112C  cameras  now  also  demonstrates  the  implementation  of
          automatic gain control (AGC).  (05-Jul-2002)

     14.  Fixed  Feature:   Using  Forceful  Memory   allocation   under   Windows
          NT/2000/XP,  and  selecting  the  wrong boot.ini selection when prompted
          during Windows' boot, may prevent Windows from starting.  (09-Aug-2002).

     15.  Fixed Feature:  Using multiple PIXCI(R)  D2X,  D3X,  CL1  under  Windows
          2000/XP,  where the cameras are tightly synchronized may cause the PC to
          lockup until rebooted or the cameras powered down.  (12-Aug-2002).













                                        - 11 -



     16.  Added Feature:  XCLIB now supports additional features of newer PIXCI(R)
          D2X,  D3X  imaging  boards for line scan cameras, increasing the maximum
          number of lines per image from 65535 to 16777216.  (15-Aug-2002).

     17.  Fixed Feature:  When using multiple PIXCI(R)  CL1  imaging  boards  with
          certain     cameras,     the    pxd_videoFieldCount    pxd_getFieldCount
          pxd_getGPTrigger functions always returned the status of unit 1, not the
          selected   unitmap,  and  the  events  created  by  pxd_eventFieldCreate
          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate pxd_eventGPTriggerCreate were signalled  by
          activity on either unit.  (22-Aug-2002).

     18.  Fixed   Feature:    On   newer   machines   under   Windows   XP,    the
          pxd_eventFieldCreate                        pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate
          pxd_eventGPTriggerCreate may cause system death  (i.e.   `blue-screen').
          (23-Aug-2002).

     19.  New Feature:  XCLIB and XCLIB-IPL for Windows now includes  static  link
          libraries,  as  an  alternative to using the dynamic link library (DLL).
          For OEM application programs that are to  be  redistributed,  using  the
          static  link libraries minimizes the number of files that must be redis-
          tributed.  (09-Sep-2002).

     20.  Improved Feature:  The ::setLiveTrigBuf  and  pxd_goLiveTrig  now  allow
          selecting  rising, falling, or either edge of the general purpose input,
          when used with PIXCI(R) SV4, SV5, D2X,  D3X,  and  CL1  imaging  boards.
          Previously, those features always used either edge.  (09-Sep-2002).

     21.  Improved Feature:  For PIXCI(R) D2X, D3X, or CL1 and line  scan  cameras
          running  in  `vertical  mastered' mode (i.e. no external VDRIVE signal),
          XCLIB now allows snapping an image starting at the next  line,  in  con-
          trast  to  snapping  when  the internal line counters `roll over'.  (25-
          Sep-2002).

     22.  Fixed Feature:  In the current release of XCLIB, the  `controlled'  mode
          parameters        of        pxd_SV2112_setVideoAndTriggerMode        and
          pxd_SV2112_setCtrlExposureAndRate may not work  as  intended.   (04-Oct-
          2002).

     23.  Added Feature:  A new example, XCLIBEX4.CPP, demonstrates sequence  cap-
          ture and display with any PIXCI(R) imaging board.  (11-Oct-2002)

     24.  Fixed Feature:  The pxd_readuchar, pxd_writeuchar,  pxd_readushort,  and
          pxd_writeushort    as    well   as   the   similar   ::imageWriteUShort,
          ::imageReadUShort,  ::imageWriteUChar,  and  ::imageReadUChar  functions
          would return 0 and read/write nothing if the specified AOI were invalid,
          such as larger than the frame buffer.  (15-Oct-2002).

     25.  Fixed Feature:  The ::bufferSaveStream and ::bufferLoadStream  functions
          may  cause  program  death when the alignsector parameter is non-zero in
          conjunction with certain combinations of cameras,  imaging  boards,  and

          operating systems.  (16-Oct-2002).

     26.  Improved Feature:  The pxd_defineImage, pxd_defineImage3, pxd_readuchar,
          pxd_writeuchar,   pxd_readushort,   and  pxd_writeushort  now  accept  a
          colorspace of `CbYCrY' to access pixel data in  UYVY  format,  supported
          only  with   a PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4, or SV5 which has been set to cap-
          ture in that format.  (28-Oct-2002).

     27.  New Feature:  A beta version of XCLIB for  the  Linux  2.4.8  kernel  is
          released.  (01-Nov-2002)

     28.  Modified Feature:  The default frame buffer memory  size  under  Windows
          NT,  2000, and XP has been increased from 4 MByte to 16 MByte.  (05-Nov-
          2002).

     29.  Fixed Feature:  For some combinations of  PIXCI(R)  imaging  boards  and
          cameras, use of pxd_defineImage3 selecting fewer than all frame buffers,
          combined with pxio8_binreadseq,  pxio8_binwriteseq,  pxio8_bin1writeseq,
          and  pxio8_bin1readseq would result saving or loading more frame buffers
          than specified.  (13-Nov-2002).

     30.  Improved Feature:  Under Windows NT, 2000, or XP the `-WT' driver confi-
          guration  parameter  now allows selecting a high resolution kernel timer
          for time stamping events.  (28-Nov-2002)

     31.  Fixed Feature:  On some machines and cameras under Windows 2000 and  XP,
          the           pxd_eventFieldCreate          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate
          pxd_eventGPTriggerCreate may cause system death.  (16-Dec-2002).

     32.  Added Feature:  The Camera Link serial API has been added to XCLIB, with
          functions  clSerialInit, clSerialClose, clSerialRead, and clSerialWrite.
          These allow access to a PIXCI(R) imaging board which was already  opened
          by XCLIB.  A separate DLL, clSerPIXCI.dll which has only the Camera Link
          Serial API, and can be distributed w/out XCLIB's licensing restrictions,
          can  be  used  to  access  the serial port PIXCI(R) imaging boards w/out
          XCLIB.  (24-Dec-2002)

     33.  Fixed Feature:  When using 3 or more PIXCI(R) imaging  boards  that  are
          combinations  of  at least 2 different models (such as D vs SV4 vs D2X),
          certain combinations of selected boards (via -DM) when installed in cer-
          tain order on the PCI bus may cause errors upon open.  (13-Jan-2003)

     34.  Fixed  Feature:   The  pxd_setExsyncPrin,   pxd_setExsyncPrincMode   and
          related  functions  were  not  enabled  for use with the PIXCI(R) CL3SD.
          (31-Jan-2003)

     35.  Fixed Feature:  For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 2112(C) when used in Controlled
          mode,    the    maximum    frame    rate    allowed    such    as    via
          pxd_SV2112_setCtrlExposureAndRate has been corrected (increased).   (04-
          Feb-2003).












                                        - 13 -



     36.  Fixed Feature:  Driver installation under Windows XP has been  improved,
          eliminating the problem under some PC configurations whereby the initial
          Plug&Play installation run's `forever', requiring a reboot and a  second
          installation.  (20-Feb-2003).

     37.  Added     Feature:      Functions      pxd_SV1310_setExposureGainOffset,
          pxd_SV1310_setResolutionAndTiming  and  other  related functions provide
          camera specific controls for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 1310  and  1310C  cam-
          eras.  (28-Feb-2003)

     38.  Improved  Feature:   The  pxd_SV2112  functions,  and   especially   the
          pxd_SV2112_get  functions, have been improved and are now faster by vir-
          tue of caching the camera's state rather  than  having  to  re-read  the
          information from the camera.  (05-Mar-2003).

     39.  Fixed Feature:  When the PIXCI(R) D2X, D3X, or CL1 is  used  in  (video)
          triggered  mode  combined  with pxd_goLive, the first triggered image is
          now captured, rather than capture starting  with  the  second  triggered
          image.  (05-Apr-2003).

     40.  Fixed    Feature:     The    subsample    parameter    to    the     new
          pxd_SV1310_setResolutionAndTiming function had the horizontal and verti-
          cal subsampling components exchanged.  Thus subsample=0x0402 would  have
          implemented  horizontal subsampling by a factor of two and vertical sub-
          sampling by a factor of four, rather than the documented horizontal sub-
          sampling  by  a  factor  of four and vertical subsampling by a factor of
          two.  (11-Apr-2003).

     41.  Improved Feature:  For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 1310 camera, the frame  rate
          can  now  be  increased by using subsampling and/or using a smaller AOI.
          Previously, only a smaller AOI would increase the frame rate.   (11-Apr-
          2003)

     42.  Fixed Feature:  Using a `struct pximage3' with operations that  read  or
          write  across  image  boundaries with a single read or write, the result
          may be incorrect.  The only known library function that this affected is
          pxio8_binreadseq.  (11-Jun-2003)

     43.  Added Feature:  A new example program, xclibex5.cpp, demonstrates use of
          non  pxd_  functions  to operate two imaging boards at different resolu-
          tions.  (06-Jun-2003)

     44.  Fixed Feature:  For the PIXCI(R) CL3SD,  under  Windows  2000,  XP,  the
          improved driver installation file, epixxcw2.inf, set

                   PIXCI= ... -WT -0x20

          to activate high resolution  timestamps.   The  superfluous  `-'  causes
          software  to believe the board has 4 GBytes of memory, regardless of the
          amount of memory actually installed.  (27-Jun-2003).












                                        - 14 -



     45.  Fixed Feature:  The pximage's optional PXUNIT* constants (which describe
          the  image's  real-world dimensional units) have been corrected; the old
          values did not fit within the uchar fields provided, namely  widthunits,
          heightunits, and depthunits.  (13-Jul-2003)

     46.  Added Feature:  The pxd_goSnapPair has been added as an SCF  version  of
          ::setSnapPairBuf;  both  intended  for  use with cameras that output two
          images with a single trigger.  (29-Jul-2003)

     47.  Added Feature:  The pxd_goLiveSeqTrig allows initiating  or  terminating
          sequence capture in response to a general purpose input or trigger, with
          less latency than possible with previously available  techniques.   (03-
          Aug-2003)

     48.  Fixed Feature:  For PIXCI(R) D, D24, D32, D2X, and D3X  imaging  boards,
          the  pxd_goLiveTrig and ::setLiveTrigBuf optional parameters delay60 and
          delay70 would implement the stated delay plus 1, rather than the  stated
          delay.   These  functions  are rarely used with those imaging boards, as
          they are only used with cameras that don't implement  triggering  within
          the camera.  (07-Aug-2003).

     49.  Modified Feature:  Due to lack of apparent  interest,  the  static  link
          libraries  for  Windows  are no longer distributed with XCLIB and XCLIB-
          IPL.  (19-Aug-2003).

     50.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now performs a power-up initialization for SIL-
          ICON  VIDEO(R) 2112 and 1310 cameras upon calling pxd_PIXCIopen.  Previ-
          ously, the cameras were initialized only by PC power-up.  (12-Sep-2003)

     51.  Fixed Feature:  Under Windows NT, 2000,  and  XP,  when  using  multiple
          instances   of   XCLIB   (via   multiple   calls   to  xclib_open),  the
          pxd_eventFieldCreate,              pxd_eventFieldClose,              and
          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate   could  not  be  used  in  more  than  one
          instance.  (13-Sep-2003).

     52.  Added     Feature:      Functions      pxd_SV1281_setExposureGainOffset,
          pxd_SV1281_setResolutionAndTiming  and  other  related functions provide
          camera specific controls for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 1281  and  1281C  cam-
          eras.  (16-Sep-2003).

     53.  Fixed Feature:  On some PC's, the SILICON  VIDEO(R)  1310(C)  would  not
          initialize  properly  after  power  up,  outputting a grey image, unless
          either (a) XCAP was run, or (b) The XCLIB  application  was  run  twice.
          (29-Sep-2003).

     54.  Improved Feature:  The PIXCI(R) SV5A  is  now  supported  distinct  from
          PIXCI(R)  SV5;  the  default  SV5A  video  setup  is NTSC, not the SV5's
          NTSC/YC.  (30-Sep-2003).














                                        - 15 -



     55.  Improved Feature:  For all currently supported  Uniq,  Basler,  Hitachi,
          and  Cohu  CameraLink  cameras  and the Jai CV-M4+CL/CV-M7+CL CameraLink
          cameras video setup files saved by XCAP now include the serial  commands
          needed  to  restore  the  camera  to  the operating mode as set in XCAP.
          XCLIB now loads those serial commands during pxd_PIXCIopen,  eliminating
          having  to follow the instructions in the Using a Serial (RS-232) Confi-
          gurable Camera with the PIXCI(R) D, D24, D32, D2X, D3X,  CL1,  or  CL3SD
          application  note.   The  same  improvement has always been provided for
          Silicon Imaging and Redlake ES-1020 cameras, but not  explicitly  noted.
          (27-Oct-2003).

     56.  Improved Feature:  Under Linux, the `Use Polling Rather than  Interrupts
          (-QU)' option is now available.  (12-Nov-2003).

     57.  Fixed Feature:  Under Linux, closing the library  may  cause  the  wrong
          (library  internal)  file `handle' to the driver to be closed, adversely
          affecting any file or device  opened  after  XCLIB.   Under  Linux,  the
          pxd_loadBmp does not work properly.  (09-Dec-2003).

     58.  Added Feature:  Functions pxd_definePximage and  pxd_definePximage3  and
          similar  to  the existing pxd_defineImage and pxd_defineImage3, but more
          convenient in multi-threaded and a few other, rare, applications.   (06-
          Jan-2004)

     59.  Fixed Feature:  Under Linux, on some motherboards, interrupts, and  thus
          notification about end-of-capture, may not work properly.  (14-Jan-2004)

     60.  Added Feature:  A new example program, XCLIBEX6.TXT, illustrates use  of
          XCLIB with VB.NET.  (16-Jan-2004).

     61.  Added Feature:  New functions pxd_saveRawBuffers and  pxd_loadRawBuffers
          have  been  added  as an SCF version of ::bufferLoadStream and ::buffer-
          SaveStream.  (02-Feb-2004)

     62.  Fixed Feature:  When using XCLIBEXC.CPPandaSILICONVIDEO(R)1310(C)with  a
          video  setup file saved by XCAP which sets a small capture AOI, the cap-
          tured image is garbled as the camera is set to one resolution while  the
          SILICON  VIDEO(R) 1310(C) specific functions invoked by XCLIBEXC.CPP set
          the PIXCI(R) imaging board to a different resolution.  (The  same  video
          setup  file  works  correctly in XCLIBEX2.CPP which does not make use of
          SILICON VIDEO(R) 1310(C) specific functions).  (31-Mar-2004).

     63.  Improved Feature:  New function pxd_mesgFaultText allows  obtaining  the
          text   describing   a   fault   from  a  SCF  style  function,  avoiding
          pxd_mesgFault's implied creation of a message box.  (12-Apr-2004).

     64.  Fixed Feature:  For Camera Link cameras where a previously  saved  video
          setup file contains serial commands with which to initialize the camera,
          XCLIB's pxd_PIXCIopen may fail with a `timeout' error.  The  problem  is
          most  likely to occur under Linux, but might occur under other operating

          systems.  (30-Apr-2004).

     65.  Improved Feature:  The XCLIB release now includes the full  XCLIB  C/C++
          Reference Manual in HTML format.  (07-May-2004).

     66.  Fixed Feature:  For rare combinations of frame buffer sizes versus frame
          buffer  memory allocation parameters, the per-buffer capture information
          reported    by    pxd_buffersFieldCount,    pxd_buffersSysTicks,     and
          pxd_buffersGPIn  may  be  destroyed  by capturing into the last, or last
          few, frame buffers.  (11-May-2004).

     67.  Fixed Feature:  For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 1281 and 1281C cameras, in some
          combinations of AOI, pixel clock and other parameters, too large a value
          of exposure is allowed, causing the captured image to be extremely  dark
          or  extremely  bright.   Also,  under Visual Basic or Delphi a divide by
          zero error may occur when the camera was not previously used  by  a  `C'
          application or XCAP.  (27-May-2004).

     68.  Fixed Feature:  For SILICON VIDEO(R) 1281 and 1281C cameras, the maximum
          exposure  as  a function of other parameters, and some internal `tweaks'
          governing timing was not consistent with XCAP.  (17-Jun-2004).

     69.  Improved Feature:  For all currently supported  DVC  CameraLink  cameras
          video  setup  files saved by XCAP now include the serial commands needed
          to restore the camera to the operating mode as set in XCAP.   See  entry
          for 27-Oct-2003 for additional information.  (11-Aug-2004).

     70.  Added Feature:  Supports the SILICON VIDEO(R) 9M001 and 9M001C  cameras,
          including  utilizing video setup files saved by XCAP to restore the cam-
          era state.  But does not yet have camera specific API  functions.   (19-
          Sep-2004).

     71.  Added Feature:  Access to color pixel values  now  supports  CMY  (cyan,
          magenta, yellow) color space.  (21-Sep-2004).

     72.  Corrected.  Documentation for  pxd_loadBmp  and  pxd_loadTiff  has  been
          corrected  to  describe the existing 0x100 option to loadmode.  (25-Oct-
          2004).

     73.  Added      Feature:       Functions      pxd_SV9M001_setExposureAndGain,
          pxd_SV9M001_setResolutionAndTiming  and  other related functions provide
          camera specific controls for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 9M001 and 9M001C  cam-
          eras.  (25-Oct-2004).

     74.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now  recognizes  and  supports  Windows  Server
          2003, a variant of XP.  (29-Nov-2004)

     75.  Fixed Feature:  For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 1281 and 1281C cameras and when
          using  a  video  setup file in non-free run mode.  The call to the first
          pxd_SV1281_*() function may change the video setup.  Previous workaround

          was to call pxd_videoFormatAsIncluded after the pxd_SV1281_*() function.
          (09-Dec-2004)

     76.  Fixed Feature:  For SILICON VIDEO(R) and other  cameras  configured  for
          per-pixel  offset  and  gain  corrections, when a) Using forceful memory
          allocation, b) Driver configuration parameter -MB non-zero, and c) Frame
          buffer  memory  mapped into application space, the per-pixel corrections
          may not be applied correctly.  (22-Dec-2004)

     77.  Improved Documentation:  For the pxd_SV2112_, pxd_SV1310_,  pxd_SV1281_,
          and  pxd_SV9M001_  functions, documentation now notes that pxd_PIXCIopen
          performs partial, quick initialization of  ;  initialization  for  these
          camera  functions  is  delayed  until the first such function is called.
          Time sensitive applications should call any of  these  camera  functions
          once  before  entering  the application's time critical phase.  (23-Dec-
          2004)

     78.  Fixed Feature:  Use of clserPIXCI.DLL (the stand-alone Camera Link  API)
          failed under Windows 95, 98 if the PIXCI(R) was not previously opened by
          XCLIB or XCAP.  (06-Jan-2005)

     79.  Added      Feature:       Functions      pxd_SV9M001_setExposureAndGain,
          pxd_SV9M001_setResolutionAndTiming  and  other related functions provide
          camera specific controls for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 9T001C  camera.   (27-
          Feb-2005).

     80.  Improved Feature:  The clserPIXCI.DLL (the stand-alone Camera Link  API)
          has  been  renamed to clserEPX.dll, and is now compliant with the Camera
          Link V1.1 specification.  (12-May-2005).

     81.  Improved Feature:  The pxd_xclibEscape now returns NULL if  the  library
          is not open.  (12-May-2005)

     82.  Fixed Feature:  The Linux version of the PIXCI(R) driver  did  not  work
          with the (very) old PIXCI(R) SV2 and SV3 imaging boards.  (25-Jun-2005)

     83.  Fixed Feature:  In beta releases of XCLIB w. support  for  the  PIXCI(R)
          CL2, the pxd_serialConfigure would ONLY work with the CL2, not the older
          CL1, CL3SD, etc.  (27-Jun-2005).

     84.  Improved Feature:  The data rate of the I2C or two wire serial bus  used
          to  control  SILICON  VIDEO(R) camera heads can now be increased via the
          `-I2C' Device Configuration Parameters so as to allow faster control  of
          gain and other camera head features when used with shorter cables.  This
          feature is particularly useful with 9T001C cameras, whose camera  head's
          control  involves  more  I2C  or two wire serial bus activity than other
          SILICON VIDEO(R) camera heads.  (04-Aug-2005).

     85.  Added Feature:  Now supports Linux 2.6.x kernels.  (03-Oct-2005).













                                        - 18 -



     86.  Added Feature:  Supports the SILICON VIDEO(R)  642M  and  642C  cameras,
          including  utilizing video setup files saved by XCAP to restore the cam-
          era        state.         Functions        pxd_SV640_setExposureAndGain,
          pxd_SV640_setResolutionAndTiming  and  other  related  functions provide
          camera specific controls for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 642M and 642C cameras.
          (23-Nov-2005).

     87.  Fixed Feature:  The pxd_readuchar  and  pxd_readushort  functions,  when
          used  to  read  an  AOI  of the image with one function call, under some
          memory configurations may return incorrect pixel data.  (22-Dec-2005).

     88.  API Tweak:  The `cnt' parameter of ::imageReadUChar,  ::imageWriteUChar,
          ::imageReadUShort,  ::imageWriteUShort, ::imageReadUInt, and ::imageWri-
          teUInt has been tweaked from `int' to `size_t'.  This has no  effect  on
          (current) 32 bit applications.  (18-Jan-2006).

     89.  Modified Feature:  The file name  of  32  bit  Linux  drivers  has  been
          changed from pixcii86.o or pixcii86.ko to pixci_i386.o or pixci_i386.ko.
          This will avoid confusion with new 64 bit Linux  drivers,  to  be  named
          pixci_x86_64.ko.   Similarly, the file names of 32 bit Linux drivers has
          changed from xclibi86.a and pxipli86.a to xclib_i386.a and  pxipl_i386.a
          (The  i386  or  x86_64  file  name components are consistent with `uname
          -i').  (30-Jan-2006).

     90.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) CL1 Rev. 3.  An older
          XCLIB  used  with a PIXCI(R) CL1 Rev. 3 is not able to correctly program
          the Camera Link serial baud rate.  (07-Feb-2006)

     91.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) E1, PCI Express imag-
          ing  board.  Note that Microsoft does not support PCI Express under Win-
          dows 95, 98, ME, or NT; neither does XCLIB.  (20-Feb-2006)

     92.  Modified Feature:  High resolution time stamping for Windows  NT,  2000,
          XP  is  now  the default for all PIXCI(R) imaging boards.  Previously it
          was the default only for the PIXCI(R) CL3SD.  (07-Apr-2006)

     93.  API Tweak:  The type of the offset parameter of ::getVidStatusValue  has
          been  changed  from uint to size_t to better accommodate 64 bit environ-
          ments.  Ditto  the  cnt  parameters  of  ::io,  ::ioctl,  pxd_readuchar,
          pxd_writeuchar,  pxd_readushort,  and  pxd_writeushort have been changed
          from uint or int to size_t.  This change does not affect 32 bit environ-
          ments, under which the two types are the same size.  (12-May-2006)

     94.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) E4,  E1DB,  and  EL1,
          PCI Express imaging boards.  (20-Feb-2006)

     95.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now supports the  PIXCI(R)  E4DB,  PCI  Express
          imaging board.  (30-Jun-2006)














                                        - 19 -



     96.  Modified Feature:  The ctobas.exe utility, to  generate  VB  and  VB.NET
          declarations,  is  no  longer  distributed.   The XCLIB distribution not
          includes VB and VB.NET declarations in XCLIB_VB.TXT and XCLIB_VBNET.TXT.
          (02-Sep-2006)

     97.  Improved Feature:  For Linux, the the `-LX' Driver Configuration Parame-
          ter  allows requesting a higher resolution timer for time stamping video
          events.  (06-Nov-2006)

     98.  Fixed Feature:  For SILICON  VIDEO(R)  9M001  and  9M001C  cameras,  the
          actual  frame  period  was  one line longer than the program's requested
          frame period.  (07-Dec-2006)

     99.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now has preliminary support  for  the  PIXCI(R)
          EC1,  Express Card imaging boards; the number of general purpose inputs,
          outputs, and triggers is not yet finalized.  (18-Dec-2006)

    100.  Fixed Feature:  On some computers with hyperthreading or  multiple  pro-
          cessors, under Windows NT, 2000, or XP, infrequent errors in Camera Link
          serial transmit or receive data may occur.  (26-Dec-2006)

    101.  Fixed Feature:  Using XCLIB-Lite, the various file  load/save  functions
          returned PXERMALLOC.  (09-Jan-2007)

    102.  Improved Feature:  Drivers for Windows 2000 and XP, as well all  Windows
          DLL's and executables, are now digitally signed.  (17-Jan-2007)

    103.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now has support for the PIXCI(R) EL1DB, Express
          Card imaging boards.  (18-Dec-2006)

    104.  Fixed Feature:  Under Linux, the pxd_doSnap() does  not  work  as  docu-
          mented.   It  sometimes  takes longer than necessary to complete, and in
          case of a timeout returns PXERDEVFAULT  instead  of  PXERTIMEOUT.   (30-
          Jan-2007)

    105.  Fixed Feature:  When using a PIXCI(R) SI, versions of XCLIB on or  after
          Oct.  2006  may incorrectly report `Camera head disconnected', depending
          on cable length.  (31-Jan-2007)

    106.  Improved Feature:  For SILICON VIDEO(R) 9T001 cameras, the (analog) gain
          and  digital  gains  have  been combined into a single, integrated gain.
          The integrated gain is easier to use, and  prevents  use  of  less  than
          optimal  settings  (such as applying digital gain before the analog gain
          is maximized).  (09-Feb-2007)

    RELEASE NOTES: XCLIB  - Version 2.1

      1.  This release supports the PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4, D,  D24,  D32,  and  A
          models,   in   Watcom+Tenberry   extended   32   bit  DOS,  and  Windows
          95/98/NT/2000 environments.  Though not documented, the 95/98 driver and












                                        - 20 -



          library also works in Windows ME.  (28-Aug-2000).

      2.  Added feature:  An additional forceful memory  allocation  method  added
          for  Windows  ME using the -IA driver configuration parameter in similar
          manner as for Windows NT.  (01-Sep-2000).

      3.  Fixed feature:  The default format (pixels per  clock)  for  the  Pulnix
          TMC-9700 is incorrect.  (04-Sep-2000)

      4.  Fixed feature:  Using pxd_getGPOut or its  non-SCF  counterpart  with  a
          PIXCI(R) D,  D24,  D32,  or A and certain Kodak 10 bit cameras may cause
          loss of the 2 least significant bits.  (7-Sep-2000).

      5.  Fixed  documentation:   Documentation   for   pxd_renderDirectVideoInit,
          pxd_renderDirectVideoDone,         pxd_renderDirectVideoLive,        and
          pxd_renderDirectVideoUnLive  showed  these  functions  as  being   named
          pxd_DirectVideoInit,   pxd_DirectVideoDone,   pxd_DirectVideoLive,   and
          pxd_DirectVideoUnLive.  The library  and  .h  files  are  not  affected.
          (15-Sep-2000).

      6.  Fixed feature:  The default format for the Dalsa CA-D4  was  incorrectly
          set as if for a line scan camera.  (19-Sep-2000).

      7.  Fixed documentation:  The documentation for pxd_goLiveSeq also  referred
          to  a  `pxd_goSnapSeq' function; the `pxd_goSnapSeq' was a typographical
          error and should have been pxd_goLiveSeq.  (28-Sep-2000).

      8.  Added feature:  Support for using interlace cameras with the PIXCI(R) D,
          D24,  D32  added with support for snap, live, and sequence capture.  The
          ::setLiveTrigBuf does not yet support interlace modes.  (29-Sep-2000)

      9.  Fixed release:  Versions of XCLIB for Windows NT  w/out  PXIPL  did  not
          included  the EPIXXCWT.SYS driver and related files.  These files can be
          obtained from the XCAP release.  (03-Nov-2000)

     10.  Added feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) D2X  series  of  imaging
          boards.  (06-Nov-2000)

     11.  Fixed documentation:  The documentation for the reserved period  parame-
          ter of ::setLivePairBuf specified that its value should be 0.  The value
          should be 1.  (09-Nov-2000).

     12.  Added feature:  The  pxd_defineImage,  pxd_defineImage3,  pxd_readuchar,
          pxd_readushort,  pxd_writeuchar,  and  pxd_writeushort now accept `GRAY'
          and `Gray' as a synonyms for `Grey', and now accept `Bayer' for  use  in
          conjunction  with cameras that actually output raw Bayer pattern values,
          and where the library would otherwise be responsible for converting  the
          values to RGB(x) or BGR(x).  (22-Dec-2000).














                                        - 21 -



     13.  Modified feature:  For Bayer output cameras, the `Default' pixel  format
          is  now  BGR  rather  than  RGB,  for  better  display  performance when
          `Default' is requested.  (Does not affect code that explicitly requested
          BGR format).  (01-Jan-2001).

     14.  Fixed feature:  A Driver Configuration  Parameter  of  `-XM'=0  (a  non-
          default value) did not work properly with multiple boards installed.

          With multiple boards, one of which having a  configuration  error  while
          others  are  selected  for  actual  use, may result in a spurious `Can't
          allocate frame buffer memory' error.  (02-Jan-2001).

     15.  Fixed Feature:  The pxd_defineImage3 did  not  accept  a  colorspace  of
          `Default' (the pxd_defineImage was not affected).  (13-Jan-2001).

     16.  Fixed  Feature:   The  pxd_defineImage  and  pxd_defineImage3  area   of
          interest  selection  may  or  may not have the correct effect, depending
          upon the function with which  the  pxd_defineImage  or  pxd_defineImage3
          result is used (a new bug only in previous release).  (13-Jan-2001).

     17.  Added Feature:  The pxd_defineImage and pxd_defineImage3  now  accept  a
          colorspace  of  `Display', which provides the most efficient color space
          for display of the frame  buffer  through  pxio8_GDIDisplay  or  similar
          functions.  (13-Jan-2001).

     18.  Fixed Feature:  Using forceful memory allocation under Windows NT,  Win-
          dows  2000,  or  DOS  with  a PIXCI(R) SV4 would result in unpredictable
          behavior the second time (since  booting)  that  the  board  is  opened.
          (16-Jan-2001).

     19.  Fixed Feature:  Calling pxd_goLiveSeq or ::setLiveSeqBuf while a  previ-
          ous  pxd_goLiveSeq or ::setLiveSeqBuf was in operation did not alter the
          numbuf setting .  (17-Jan-2001)

     20.  Added Feature:  XCLIB now supports the two G.P In and two G.P  Out  bits
          for the PIXCI(R) D2X series of imaging boards.  (24-Jan-2001).

     21.  Fixed Feature:  For PIXCI(R) SV4 imaging boards in ::setLiveSeqBuf mode,
          a  ::getLiveStatus  using  PXVIST_RUNNING  always  returned 0.  (31-Jan-
          2001).

     22.  Added        Feature:         The        pxd_eventFieldCreate        and
          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate allow the application to be signalled via a
          Windows event at the start of each field, and/or at the end of each cap-
          tured    field.     Under    Tenberry+DOS,    pxd_eventFieldCreate   and
          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate allow specifying a `callback'  function  to
          be  invoked  at  the start of each field, and/or at the end of each cap-
          tured field.  (06-Feb-2001).














                                        - 22 -



     23.  Improved Feature:  A new EPIXXCW2.SYS driver for Windows  2000  provides
          better   compatibility  with  newer  motherboards.   In  particular,  it
          resolves a problem with motherboards using early  800  series  chipsets,
          which  would  not provide interrupts.  The older EPIXXCWT.SYS driver for
          Windows NT may still be used under Windows 2000 on all  previously  sup-
          ported motherboards.  (20-Feb-2001).

     24.  Fixed feature:  The default format  for  the  SMD  4M15  was  incorrect.
          (27-Mar-2001).

     25.  Added Feature:  New function pxd_setExsyncPrincMode,  pxd_getExsyncMode,
          and  pxd_getPrincMode  allow  setting camera configuration bits, but not
          suggested for use in favor of loading a new video configuration format.

          New service pxd_videoFormatAsIncluded allows configuring XCLIB as per  a
          video  configuration format that has been compiled into the application,
          and without re-opening XCLIB.  (01-Apr-2001).

     26.  Fixed Feature:  The ::setLiveTrigBuf used with a  PIXCI(R)  SV4  imaging
          board did not always set the `gpout60value' or `gpout80value' correctly.
          (08-May-2001)

     27.  Added Feature:  The ::setLiveTrigBuf is now supported for  the  PIXCI(R)
          D2X imaging boards.  (09-May-2001).

     28.  Added feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) CL1  series  of  imaging
          boards  for  Camera  Link  cameras.   New functions pxd_serialConfigure,
          pxd_serialRead, and pxd_serialWrite support  reading  and  writing  data
          through the PIXCI(R) CL1.  (15-May-2001).

     29.  Fixed feature:   Under  Windows  NT  and  2000,  the  event  created  by
          pxd_eventFieldCreate  and pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate is initially sig-
          nalled; thus the first WaitForSingleObject would always  return  immedi-
          ately.    For   PIXCI(R)  D2X  imaging  boards,  the  event  created  by
          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate behaved the same as  an  event  created  by
          pxd_eventFieldCreate.  (18-May-2001).

     30.  Added Feature:  The XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) SV5  imaging  board.
          (29-May-2001).

     31.  Fixed Feature:  Under Windows 2000, the PIXCI(R) SV5 would appear as two
          devices, (1) The SV5, and (2) A (18-Jun-2001).

     32.  Added Feature:  The XCLIB now support  opening  multiple,  simultaneous,
          instances  of  the  library;  allowing  use  of multiple, non-identical,
          PIXCI(R) imaging boards.  The multiple instances must be opened from the
          same process, with multi-thread synchronization provided by the applica-
          tion program.  (01-Jul-2001).














                                        - 23 -



     33.  Fixed Feature:  The new  pxd_serialWrite  did  not  function  correctly.
          (03-Jul-2001).

     34.  Modified feature:  For PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4,  and  SV5,  for  PAL  and
          CCIR,  the default video setup has been changed to avoid capturing black
          lines at the top of the image.  (06-Jul-2001).

     35.  Fixed Feature:  When using Forceful Memory allocation under  Windows  NT
          or  2000,  the  frame  buffer  memory  would not be cleared when Windows
          booted.  Rather, the memory, or  a  portion  of  the  memory,  would  be
          cleared each time the library/driver was opened.  (18-Jul-2001).

     36.  Fixed Feature:  The ::setLiveTrigBuf did not work with the PIXCI(R) D2X,
          causing program or PC hang-ups.  (20-Jul-2001).

     37.  Modified  feature:   The  size  of   the   serial   data   buffers   for
          pxd_serialRead  and pxd_serialWrite have been increased from 32 bytes to
          1024 bytes.  (28-Jul-2001).

     38.  Fixed Feature:  For PIXCI(R) D, D24, D32, D2X, or CL1, specifying  video
          resolution  `setmaxdatsamples'  or  `setmaxvidsamples' with insufficient
          frame buffer memory to  achieve  maximum  resolution  would  (correctly)
          cause  the  `setmax...samples'  to be overridden and a less than maximum
          resolution to be used.  However, the X & Y resolution  used,  trading  X
          resolution for Y resolution, would not be consistent.  (05-Aug-2001).

     39.  Fixed Feature:  Trying to open a imaging board while already in  use  by
          an  earlier  application  correctly  produced  an error, but incorrectly
          closed the imaging board and deprived the  earlier  application  of  its
          use.  (13-Aug-2001).

     40.  Fixed Feature:  Support for opening  multiple,  non-identical,  PIXCI(R)
          imaging  boards  was  not  fully  included  in Windows NT/2000 versions.
          (17-Aug-2001).

     41.  Added  Feature:   New  functions  pxd_buffersFieldCount  pxd_buffersGPIn
          pxd_buffersSysTicks  provide  the  time and value of the general purpose
          inputs for each captured buffer.  (16-Sep-2001).

     42.  Added Feature:  New function pxd_goLiveTrig allows using  ::setLiveTrig-
          Buf within the SCF functions.  (25-Sep-2001).

     43.  Fixed Feature:  The ::setLiveTrigBuf did not work with the PIXCI(R) D2X,
          causing the `wait for g.p. input' to never be satisfied.  (05-Oct-2001).

     44.  Fixed   Feature:    The   colorspace   parameter    of    pxd_readuchar,
          pxd_writeuchar  and similar functions is documented as allowing a selec-
          tion of `YCrCb', `YofYCrCb', `RofYCrCb', and `BofYCrCb', but the library
          instead   required  `YCRCB',  `YofYCRCB',  `RofYCRCB',  and  `BofYCRCB'.
          Either `YCRCB' or `YCrCb', and their variants, are  now  allowed.   (05-

          Oct-2001)

     45.  Fixed Feature:  The ::importStateCopy  and  ::exportStateCopy,  and  the
          third  parameter  of  pxd_PIXCIopen  did  not always work properly under
          Watcom+Tenberry.  (24-Oct-2001).

     46.  Modified Feature:  A twelfth  parameter,  trackers  has  been  added  to
          ::setLiveSeqBuf; existing code should simply add a final parameter of 0.
          (28-Oct-2001).

     47.  Added feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) D3X  series  of  imaging
          boards.  (Oct-2001)

     48.  Added Feature:  XCLIB now supports the G.P. In and G.P.  Out  bits  that
          have  been  added  to  newer  released of PIXCI(R) CL1 boards.  (12-Nov-
          2001).

    RELEASE NOTES: XCLIB  - Version 0.0 Beta

      1.  Fixed  Feature.   The  pxd_readuchar,  pxd_writeuchar,   pxd_readushort,
          pxd_writeushort,  as  well  as their ::imageReadUChar, ::imageWriteUChar
          ::imageReadUShort, ::imageWriteUShort equivalents do not  work  properly
          on an image AOI.  (27-Jun-2000).
