0. To launch pr2 navigation stack with gmapping:
roslaunch pr2_gazebo map_building_demo.launch
rosrun rviz rviz
rosrun map_server map_saver map:=map
(was dynamic_map in tutorial)
roslaunch pr2_teleop teleop_keyboard.launch
launch gmapping on its own
rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping map_building_demo_gmapping_only.launch 

0.1 Version without 
roslaunch pr2_gazebo map_building_demo_no_gmapping.launch 
rosrun rviz rviz
rosrun map_server map_saver map:=map
(was dynamic_map in tutorial)
roslaunch pr2_teleop teleop_keyboard.launch
launch gmapping on its own
roslaunch gmapping map_building_demo_only_gmapping_inside_gmapping.launch

2. Comparison of ros-gmapping to openslam-gmapping
Equivalent Directories:
~/gmapping/trunch  (openslam)
/opt/ros/cturtle/stacks/slam_gmapping/gmapping/build/gmapping_export/ (ros-gmapping)
- openslam contains svn r40, ros contains svn r39



3. What rosmake looks like:
mfallon@jleonard-dell2:~/ros/stacks/slam_gmapping/gmapping$ rosmake 
[ rosmake ] No package specified.  Building ['gmapping']
