Example 1 - Reading the end position of the WAM.

This is meant to be the simplest possible program that uses a wam. All it does is
initialize the wam communications, data structures, and start the control loop thread.


To compile & run

1. #make
2. Switch on WAM
3. Idle WAM (press SHIFT and IDLE buttons on pendant. The yellow light should come on)
4. #./run

Things to note:

./.runinfo - The name of your executable is placed in this config file. ./run is
a script to do all the things needed by RTAI in order to run your program in realtime.

./Makefile - note the location of the barrett include files and libraries

The esdcan-driver module must be loaded
