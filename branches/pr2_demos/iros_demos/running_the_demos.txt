Initial setup:
      Angle table so that left side is closer to robot than right side.

During demo:
      Once the table wiping gets to the point where it has the right
      hand by the table and is asking you if you want to start the
      demo, you should scatter bits of cardboard on the table (no more
      than 65 cm from the robot and only left of its center), put the
      box in the robot's right hand and a cloth in its left hand.

      If it was unable to move its right arm into position, DO NOT
      give it a box or scatter bits on the table.

Running demos:
   Whole demo:	
      $ roscd demo_exec/scripts
      $ python run_demos.py
   Just controller demos:
      $ roscd controller_demos/src
      $ python controller_demos.py
   Just table wiping:
      $ roscd table_wiping_demo/src/table_wiping_demo
      $ python wipe_table.py

   Adjusting parameters for table wiping:
      Where the head looks:
