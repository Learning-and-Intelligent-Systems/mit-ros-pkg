=========== 1. Recording Lidar Data on the PR2 ==================
0. On your laptop, set the ROS_MASTER_URI environment variable (so that your laptop to find the pr2).
0.1 For running the robot:
> export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://pr2mm1:11311
0.2 For simulation or data playback WITHOUT the robot set it to:
> export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
(these variables can be set in your .bashrc file to avoid having to do it again and again)

1. log into one of the pr2 computers:
> ssh yourusername@pr2mm1.csail.mit.edu
other computer is pr2mm2.csail.mit.edu but everything is run from pr2mm1

1.1 (on the robot) kill all other ros processes
> sudo robot start
- starts all basic processes (eg excludes prosilica)

2. if joystick red buttons not flashing hit playstation button

3. (on your laptop) start the dashboard which displays the robot status:
> rosrun pr2_dashboard pr2_dashboard

5. (on the robot) launch on robot:
> roslaunch pr2_2dnav_slam pr2_2dnav.launch 
5a (on the robot) to record data to a file for later:
> rosbag record /base_scan /tf /tilt_scan (etc ......)

6. (on the laptop) run the visualization tool:
> rosrun rviz rviz

7. (on the pr2?) launch the teleoperation
roslaunch pr2_teleop teleop_joystick.launch

8. spit out an map: (not sure what this is for - I've left it in here for now)
> rosrun map_server map_saver map:=map



TIP1: "screen" - used to attaching and detaching to remote terminals:
> screen          ... activate screen (then hit enter)
> ctrl+a, then d  ... deteach the screen
... leave, go home, come back another day. log onto remote machine
> screen -r       ... reattach to the screen and resume work
> ctrl+a, escape  ... history mode. scroll up to see output while detached

TIP2: To avoid having to have 6+ terminals you can pipe output to null:
rosrun pr2_teleop teleop_pr2 &> /dev/null &
... perhaps best to avoid this initially
